This is a public repository to store the hashes of my most important files for future audit purposes.

The filenames themselves are encrypted using AES256 CBC, while the hashes are SHA512. The salt and bin are encrypted with VeraCrypt and stored elsewhere. The script will also be publicly available.

04:12, Friday, April 18, 2025 (GMT-3), Time in Bras√≠lia, Federal District: The script is now publicly available, as well as the PGP signature file for the zip file containing the hashed files.

I'll see to it that the public key is upload, if I determine it necessary.
